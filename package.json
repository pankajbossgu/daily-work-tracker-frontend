## ðŸš€ Final Steps: The Full Restart

Please follow these steps exactly. This process will unify your connection and allow the login request to finally reach your Node.js server.

1.  **Save** the updated `server.js` (Port 3005) and the updated `package.json` (Proxy 3005).
2.  **Stop both your backend and frontend servers.** (Use `Ctrl+C` in both terminals).
3.  **Start the Backend first.** The console **must** read: `Server is listening on port 3005`.
4.  **Start the Frontend second.**
5.  Try logging in again.

If the login works, both the login error and the task loading error (which is also a connection issue) should be fixed simultaneously.
